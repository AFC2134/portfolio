        About Me
    </span></h1>
        <p>Hello World! A well traditioned first proclomation that a web designer is indeed now in the business. My name is Alex Cooney, I am currently based in Austin, Tx. 
          I am a Boston native, but spent my early years overseas. Along with Web Development, I also enjoy teaching, playing, and working in music. 
          I have found many simularities in how logical structures of basic concepts build on each other. Through my work in music as well as a Full-Stack Web Developer, I have found that the most elegant artistic structures are built through thorugh understanding of a mediums fundamental rules.
           Web design is no differnt in this aspect. I aim to give the highest quality design, and of course, a streamlined and functional platform for customers and clients to reach out and touch the world themseleves.
           
          <br>
           Below are several pieces and projects I would love to showcase for you. </p>
